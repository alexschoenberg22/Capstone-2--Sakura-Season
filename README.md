Problem identification: What is the best date to travel to Hirosaki Park to most likely see the sakura at peak blossom?

Context: One of the most beautiful (and popular!) experiences for tourists in Japan and Japanese people alike is viewing the blooming sakura flowers. Each spring, these flowers bloom for a relatively short period of time, and their season is beloved and celebrated within Japanese culture. Tourists come from far and wide specifically to see them, and Japanese families gather for picnics in their local parks. The exact timing and duration of the sakura’s peak blossom depends heavily upon the temperature patterns in the months leading up to early spring, and this project seeks to determine when a visitor can plan a trip and reasonably expect to see the flowers at their best for the year.

Criteria for success: The model will determine, based on weather in months leading to spring, which date is most likely for peak sakura blossom at Hirosaki Park in Hirosaki City, Japan. 

Scope of solution space: The model will answer the question of “best” cherry blossom date for one notable park in Japan.

Constraints: Weather and nature both carry some inherent level of unpredictability. A forecast of anything in this realm cannot be 100% reliable 100% of the time due to any number of factors, not even necessarily in the immediate vicinity of this specific park. For example, an unexpected natural event such as a volcano eruption somewhere along or in the Pacific Rim region could affect temperatures, air quality, wind, tsunami/flooding likelihood, etc. in ways that the model would not otherwise take into effect. Man-made disasters or events could also occur that change the environment and affect the blooming of sakura.

Stakeholders: Stakeholders in this project include any individuals who wish to view the Japanese cherry blossoms in Hirosaki Park. This could be travelers from far-flung continents, families from the next street over, or anyone in between.

Data sources: The data set used in this project is from Kaggle, providing temperature data and flower status for Hirosaki Park from January 1, 1997 to December 31, 2019. The temperature data is sourced from the Japanese Meteorological Agency, and sakura status data is sourced from the Hirosaki City Green Association.

Method: The initial method will be to use graphical analysis to determine a relationship between temperature patterns and sakura blooming date, then create a model that will provide predicted trends for future year(s) based on this relationship.
